GENERAL ERIC:
              HELLO SOLDIER, I'M THE GENERAL ERIC, YOU'RE HERE FOR A VERY SPECIAL
              MISSION.
              I RECENTLY GOT STOLEN MY GOLDEN FRIE, YOU MUST BRING IT BACK TO ME
              OR I RISK LOSING WEIGHT.
              GO NOW, OVER.
                                                                    PRESS ENTER TO CLOSE
